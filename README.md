# Zion Language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zionlang/zion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zionlang/zion)

Zion is a programming language. Zion prefers correctness and readability over
performance. Zion targets scenarios where scalability is intended to happen
horizontally, not vertically. That being said, Zion tries to be fast, using static compilation to
native host architecture as its execution model. Zion is built on LLVM.

## Goals

 - Keep it simple, when possible.
 - Keep it readable, when possible.
 - Keep it stateless, when possible. Avoid mutability. Gently nudge the
   developer towards product and sum types when they are modeling stateful things.
 - The ability to express complex domain relationships with static types is
   critical.
 - Most pain in software development is felt near process boundaries. Be
   opinionated on how to make serialization as comfortable as possible while
   retaining static type safety.
 - Compile down to a copyable binary.

## Non-goals
 - Heavy compute problems are a non-goal, solve those problems at a lower level,
   and use the FFI, or RPC to access those components/services. Generally
   performance optimization is treated as an unwelcome afterthought. Favor
   algorithms and horizontal scaling over bit twiddling.

## Notes

Zion looks a bit like Python:

```
module hello_world

def main()
	print("Hello, world!")
```

Here's an old friend:
```
def fib(n int) int
	if n <= 2
		return 1

	return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Zion uses contains elements from ML's type system. Zion is strict, not lazy.  Memory is managed using
garbage collection.

### TODO
- [ ] discuss namespaces.
- [ ] discuss future plans for safe dynamic dispatch.
- [ ] discuss the std library layout.

## Syntax

The Backusâ€“Naur form for the syntax is in `syntax.ebnf`.

## Type system

Zion uses unification to match substitutable types at function callsites.
Type inference is built-in. The only automatic coercion that Zion performs is
to look for `__bool__` values for conditional statements. (TODO: revisit this
explanation...)

Types are declared as follows:

```
# Declare a structure type (aka product type, aka "struct")
type Vector2D has
	var x float
	var y float

# Note the use of the word "has" after the type name. This signifies that the
# Giraffe type "has" the succeeding "dimensions" of data associated with its
# instances.
type Giraffe has
	var name str
	var age int
	var number_of_spots int

type Gender is Male or Female

type Lion has
	var name str
	var age int
	var gender Gender

type Mouse has
	var fur_color str

# tags are how you declare a global singleton enum values.

tag Zion
tag Yellowstone
tag Yosemite

type NationalPark is
	Zion or
	Yellowstone or
	Yosemite

type Bison has
	var favorite_national_park NationalPark

# Types are not limited to being included in only one sum type, they can be
# included as subtypes of multiple supertypes. Note that Mouse is a possible
# substitutable type for either AfricanAnimal, or NorthAmericanAnimal.

type AfricanAnimal is
	Lion or
	Giraffe or
	Mouse

type NorthAmericanAnimal is
	Mouse or
	Bison
```
etc...

Some examples of standard types are:
```
type bool is
	true or
	false

# The squiggly braces are "type variables", they are not bound to the type until
# an instance of the type is created by calling its implicit constructor. If the
# "has" type contains 2 dimensions, then the generated constructor takes 2
# parameters. The question-mark indicates that the preceding type is a "maybe"
# type. This means that it can sometimes be nil. Zion will try its best to not
# let you dereference nil pointers.

```

The bool and vector types are declared in the standard library exactly as depicted
above. See `lib/std.zion`.

When a call to a function that takes a sum type and there still remain free type
variables, they will be substituted with the "unreachable" type (void) during
function instantiation.


### TODO

- [ ] 'for' syntax - based on `tests/test_list_iter.zion` pattern
- [x] vectors
- [ ] decide on `with` (Python) / `using` (C#) / 'defer' (Golang) style syntax for deterministic destruction
- [ ] consider overloading += operator semantics for vectors (instead of relying on `append`)
- [x] Ternary operator
- [x] Logical and/or (build with ternary operator)
- [x] Type refinements for ternary / conditional expressions (it works. see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/wbbradley/6dc1ab1e12ce4312c83cd33012eb721b))
- [ ] fully implement binary as! -> T, as -> maybe{T}
- [ ] Builtin data structures
  - [x] vectors
  - [ ] hash map - looking into hash array map tries
  - [ ] binary tree
  - [ ] avl tree
- [ ] Use DIBuilder to add line-level debugging information
- [ ] Rework debug logging to filter based on taglevels, rather than just one global level (to enable debugging particular parts more specifically)
